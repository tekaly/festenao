# Implementation Plan: `festenao_google_auth`

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the `festenao_google_auth` package.

## Phase 1: Project Setup

-   [ ] Create a Flutter package in the `packages_flutter/festenao_google_auth` directory.
-   [ ] Remove the `test/` directory.
-   [ ] Update the `description` in `pubspec.yaml` to "A package to configure Firebase UI for Google and email authentication." and set the `version` to `0.1.0`.
-   [ ] Create a `README.md` with a short placeholder description.
-   [ ] Create a `CHANGELOG.md` with an initial version of `0.1.0`.
-   [ ] Commit the initial empty package to the `feat/festenao_google_auth` branch.

After completing this phase, I will:

-   [ ] Run `dart_fix --apply` to clean up the code.
-   [ ] Run `dart analyze` and fix any issues.
-   [ ] Run `dart format .` to ensure correct formatting.
-   [ ] Re-read `IMPLEMENTATION.md` to check for any changes.
-   [ ] Update the "Journal" section in `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
-   [ ] Use `git diff` to verify the changes and create a commit message for your approval.

## Phase 2: Implementation

-   [ ] Add `firebase_ui_auth` and `firebase_ui_oauth_google` as dependencies.
-   [ ] Create `lib/festenao_google_auth.dart` with the `initFestenaoGoogleAuth` function as specified in the design document.
-   [ ] Create a `test/` directory and a `festenao_google_auth_test.dart` file with a basic test to ensure the package is importable.

After completing this phase, I will:

-   [ ] Create/modify unit tests for the code added.
-   [ ] Run `dart_fix --apply`.
-   [ ] Run `dart analyze`.
-   [ ] Run any tests.
-   [ ] Run `dart format .`.
-   [ ] Re-read `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
-   [ ] Update the "Journal" section in `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
-   [ ] Use `git diff` to verify the changes and create a commit message for your approval.

## Phase 3: Finalization

-   [ ] Create a comprehensive `README.md` file for the package.
-   [ ] Create a `GEMINI.md` file in the project directory that describes the package, its purpose, and implementation details.
-   [ ] Ask you to inspect the package and say if you are satisfied with it.
